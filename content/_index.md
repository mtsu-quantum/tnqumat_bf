The **TN-QuMat project** is supported by the **U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Researching New Energy Sciences Workforce (RENEW) initiative**, which aims to develop a skilled and diverse workforce in critical areas of national research. **TN-QuMat** is a collaborative initiative between MTSU (PI Hanna Terletska, Co-PI, John Villanova), TSU, (Co-PI Richard Mu), Fisk University (Co-PI Ning Zhang) and Oak Ridge National Laboratory (PI Thomas Maier, Co-PI Tom Berlijn).

Quantum materials are at the heart of cutting-edge advancements in quantum information science and engineering. These materials, including those with strong electronic correlations, disorder, and topological properties, are key to next-generation quantum computing, sensing, and communication technologies. Understanding and harnessing their unique quantum behaviors require advanced theoretical modeling, computational simulations, and experimental synthesis—areas of growing national priority.

To make progress in the field, a well-trained quantum workforce is needed at all levels—undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral. However, access to structured quantum education and training programs remains limited in many regions, particularly in Middle Tennessee, where Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and emerging R2 institutions lack the necessary infrastructure, mentorship, and research capacity.

## Project Goals

The goal of the project is to develop a sustainable quantum-ready workforce in Tennessee, focusing on advancing research, training the quantum training, and fostering collaboration. The project is structured around four key thrusts:

- **Advancing Quantum Materials Research**
    - Conduct cutting-edge research in three thrust areas:
        1. Many-body theory and simulation of disordered quantum materials to study electron interactions and disorder effects.
        2. Ab initio studies of topological quantum materials for discovering new quantum phases and applications.
        3. Synthesis and characterization of low-dimensional quantum structures to design materials for quantum technologies.
    - Leverage ORNL’s world-class facilities to push the boundaries of quantum materials science.
- **TN Quantum Ready Workforce Development**
    - Train undergraduates, graduate students, and postdocs in quantum materials research through mentorship, hands-on projects, and professional development.
    - Expand programs like the AMPLIFY Scholars and offer internships at ORNL to prepare participants for STEM careers.
- **Broadening Participation**
    - Actively recruit students from all STEM fields interested in quantum-related careers.
    - Build inclusive pathways into quantum science through inter-institutional collaborations, scholarships, and outreach programs.
- Strengthening Partnerships
    - Foster collaboration between MTSU, TSU, Fisk University, and ORNL to integrate resources and expertise.
    - Position Tennessee as a hub for quantum education, research, and workforce development.
